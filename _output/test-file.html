      <h2>How Will Your Reader Respond to Your Tone?</h2>
      <h3>Why should tone and voice be considered?</h3>
      <p>Sensitivity to the audience’s stance on a particular topic will affect their perception of the writer as the argument unfolds; a respectful tone is more likely to reach the audience than one that is condescending. When the goal is to persuade an audience with an opposing view, empathetic writers think carefully about how their tone and voice will affect their readers.</p>

      <h4>Consider these questions related to tone and voice:</h4>
      <ul class="video-container">
        <li>What is the writer’s stance? Is the intent to inform or to persuade?</li>
        <li>What tone and voice is most appropriate for the target audience?</li>
        <li>Are the tone and voice respectful?</li>
        <li>How can the content be presented so it is informative and persuasive but not condescending?</li>
        <li>What words demonstrate sensitivity to the audience’s views and feelings?</li>
        <li>Have any insensitive words or examples been presented that are likely to cause offense to the readers?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mindful Tips When Writing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Never Use Racial Profiling</b>: Racial slurs, profiling or any other form in a professional document are unacceptable in every instance. NO matter how comfortable you are with your audience. If the document were to come in the possession of unintended hands it could look highly negative upon you. The professional world on no level tolerates writing like this. Save it for your personal or individual writing.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Never Use Profanity</b>: Again, this is not accepted in the professional world on any level. Even writing between co-workers, can offend and look negatively upon you.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Be Mindful and Respectful of Religious Beliefs</b>: Avoid words like <em>bless, god, covet, bible, or any other religious connotations</em>. Avoid mentioning holiday names, for example; <em>“During the Christmas Season…”</em>, but rather <em>“During this holiday season…”</em>. This will ensure no one group feels excluded or discriminated against. Again, writing in this way is just professional courtesy.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Avoid Slang</b>: This is a general tip for all writing, but avoiding slang terms will ensure your words are not misconstrued and taken other than your intended meaning.</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Write As if the World is Reading</b>: Once you have written your ideas on any medium; computer, email, paper, etc., everyone has access to it. Remember your writing is becoming public knowledge. You have no idea who will run across your document, so ensure there is no compromising information.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Use Language That is Sensitive to Your Audience</h2>
      <div id="post-1057">
        <h3>Why is it important to use language that is sensitive to the target audience?</h3>
        <p>When writers use language that implies a biased or judgmental attitude, the audience may take offense and be less apt to listen to the writer’s argument. Language that is insensitive to gender, ethnicity, or disability should be avoided.</p>
        <p>Just as writers hope their audience will be willing to respect their point of view, they need to respect the diversity of a broad base of readers. Language that is inclusive and fair may contribute to the credibility of the writer and uphold the audience’s sense of dignity and self-worth.</p>
        <h4>What revisions will help to promote sensitive, fair language?</h4>
        Use gender-inclusive language:
        <ul>
          <li><em>they</em> instead of <em>he or she </em>(if speaking about people in general)<em>
            </em></li>
          <li><em>humankind</em> instead of <em>mankind</em></li>
          <li><em>garbage collector</em> instead of <em>garbage man</em></li>
          <li><em>server</em> instead of <em>waitress</em></li>
        </ul>
        Use correct or accepted racial and ethnic terms:
        <ul>
          <li><em>African American</em> instead of <em>colored </em>or<em> Negro<br>
            </em></li>
          <li><em>Asian</em> instead of <em>Oriental</em></li>
          <li><em>American Indian </em>or<em> Native American</em> instead of <em>Indian</em></li>
          <li><em>Native Alaskan</em> or<em> Inuit</em> instead of <em>Eskimo</em></li>
          <li><em>Hispanic</em> instead of <em>Spanish</em></li>
        </ul>
        Use language that respects people for who they are or recognizes a specific ailment:
        <ul>
          <li><em>persons with disabilities</em> instead of <em>handicapped</em>,<em> challenged</em>, <em>disabled, </em>or<em> retarded</em></li>
          <li><em>visually impaired</em> instead of <em>blind</em></li>
          <li><em>persons with hearing loss</em> instead of <em>deaf individuals</em></li>
          <li><em>mentally ill</em> instead of <em>crazy, moron, </em>or<em> loony</em></li>
          <li><em>those with arthritis</em> instead of <em>arthritis sufferers</em></li>
          <li><em>people with diabetes</em> instead of <em>diabetes patients</em></li>
        </ul>
