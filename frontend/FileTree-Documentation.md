# FileTree Component Documentation

## Overview

The `FileTree` component is a React component designed to render a hierarchical file system view (a file tree) from a flat array of file objects. Its primary purpose is to take unstructured path data and build a structured, nested representation that can be easily rendered.

## How It Works

The component's main responsibility is to transform the `files` prop into a tree data structure.

### Input Data

The component expects a `files` prop, which is an array of objects. Each object must have a `path` property, which is a string representing its full path from the root. Other properties like `type` and `size` are also used.

**Example Input:**
```json
[
  { "path": "src/components/FileTree.jsx", "type": "file", "size": 1234 },
  { "path": "src/App.jsx", "type": "file", "size": 5678 },
  { "path": "public", "type": "folder" }
]
```

### Tree Construction Algorithm

The component initializes an empty root node for the tree. It then iterates over each file object provided in the `files` prop and performs the following steps for each one:

1.  **Path Splitting**: The `path` string is split by the `/` delimiter into its constituent parts. For example, `src/components/FileTree.jsx` becomes `['src', 'components', 'FileTree.jsx']`.

2.  **Tree Traversal**: Starting from the root of the tree, the algorithm traverses the structure, part by part.

3.  **Node Creation**: For each part of the path, it checks if a child node with that name already exists in the current directory.
    *   If a node **does not exist**, it creates one. The new node is typed as a `'folder'` if there are more parts in the path to process, or as a `'file'` (or its given type) if it's the last part.
    *   If a node **does exist**, it simply moves into that node to process the next part of the path.

### Handling Edge Cases: File-to-Folder "Upgrades"

A critical challenge arises when the input data is ambiguous or contains conflicting paths. For example, the input might contain both a file `a.txt` and another file located at `a.txt/b.txt`.

A naive implementation would first create `a.txt` as a **file node**. When it then tries to process `a.txt/b.txt`, it would need to add `b.txt` as a child of `a.txt`. This is impossible for a simple file node (which has no `children` property) and would cause a runtime error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'find')`.

The current logic robustly handles this scenario by **"upgrading" nodes on the fly**.

During the path traversal, if the algorithm encounters an existing node that is a file but needs to be a directory (because there are more path segments to process), it dynamically converts that file node into a folder node.

This is achieved by:
1.  Changing the node's `type` to `'folder'`.
2.  Adding an empty `children` array to it.

This enhancement ensures that the tree can be built correctly even with malformed or overlapping path data, preventing runtime errors and making the component more resilient.

## Code Snippet

The core of this logic is in the `forEach` loop that processes each path part. The `else if` block contains the "upgrade" logic.

```javascript
parts.forEach((part, idx) => {
  // Find if a node for the current path part already exists.
  let existing = current.children.find((c) => c.name === part);

  if (!existing) {
    // If it doesn't exist, create it as a file or folder.
    existing =
      idx === parts.length - 1
        ? { type: file.type || "file", name: part, path: file.path, size: file.size }
        : { type: "folder", name: part, children: [], path: (current.path ? current.path + "/" : "") + part };
    current.children.push(existing);
  } else if (idx < parts.length - 1 && !existing.children) {
    // *** The Fix ***
    // If a file exists where a directory should be, "upgrade" it.
    existing.type = "folder";
    existing.children = [];
  }
  
  // Move to the next node in the tree.
  current = existing;
});
```

## Component Usage

Here is a basic example of how to use the `<FileTree />` component.

```jsx
import FileTree from './components/FileTree';

const myFiles = [
  { path: 'README.md', type: 'file' },
  { path: 'src/index.js', type: 'file' },
];

function App() {
  const handleFileSelect = (filePath) => {
    console.log('Selected:', filePath);
  };

  return <FileTree files={myFiles} onSelect={handleFileSelect} />;
}
```
